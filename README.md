# Overlay Control

I have done a variety of esports stream production for different groups and noticed there
wasn't any prominent tool for modifying overlays. Adjusting sources in streaming software during a live
production is difficult, slow, and often leads to production errors. This tool is designed to simplify the process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development or production purposes.

### Development Prerequisites

* [Java](https://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp)
* [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)


### Stream Setup

If you are only interested in using the Overlay Control tool then you only need the OverlayControl folder that contains the Assets
folder and OverlayControl.jar file.
After downloading, set the sources in your streaming/recording software to the appropriate files in the Assets folder.
Do not move or rename any of the files, otherwise the application will not work. Open the OverlayControl.jar file and
edit the fields as desired. Team1 inputs are on the left side of the application, and Team2 inputs are on the right.
